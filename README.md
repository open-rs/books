|[Why Rust?](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/why-rust/9781492048589/)|    Jim Blandy (by O'Reilly Media, Inc.)   	|     English     	|   Released 2015     	|  While systems programming languages have greatly evolved since the introduction of C more than 40 years ago, our capacity for dumb mistakes with enormous consequences has remained unchanged, with vivid examples regularly in the news. This O'Reilly report examines Rust, a new systems programming language that combines safety and security with performance on a par with C and C++.        	|   false   	|  9781491927298    |
|[The Rust Programming Language](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-rust-programming/9781492067665/)|    Steve Klabnik, Carol Nichols (by O'Reilly Media, Inc.)   	|     English     	|   Released 2018     	|  The Rust Programming Language begins with a quick hands-on project to introduce the basics, then explores key concepts in depth, such as ownership, the type system, error handling, and fearless concurrency. Detailed explanations of Rust-oriented takes on topics like pattern matching, iterators, and smart pointers combine with examples and exercises to take you from theory to practice.       	|   false   	|  9781593278519    |
